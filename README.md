# Data Structures and Algorithms in Javascript
This repository contains popular data structures and algorithms implemented in Javascript. Also included is a test file with every problem statement to verify whether it passes the testcases.  
  
Each data-structure and algorithm will also contain a readme file to explain the necessary concepts as well as the approach to be followed for solving the problem. At the end, the space and time complexities will also be mentioned for the solution.  
  
🎉 If you are a beginner Javascript developer I hope you will learn a lot from this repository. If you are an experiencied developer I hope you could find something useful.  
  
All contributions to this repository is welcomed with ❤️  
  
## Quick Overview of Data Structures and Algorithms

A **data structure** is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. This is particularly important when we have to deal with large amounts of data. If we do not posses the knowledge of common data structures, our programs will consume a lot of space in the memory and will be very difficult to access. 

For example, suppose we have to store a bank statement of a customer. By using arrays we can store it easily. This helps in reducing the use of number of variables as we don’t need to create a separate variable for every credit or debit. All records can be accessed by simply traversing the array.

Data Structures that we will discuss in this repository are: 

- [Array](https://github.com/rahulSlash/data-structures-algorithms-javascript)  
- [Matrix](https://github.com/rahulSlash/data-structures-algorithms-javascript)  
- [LinkedList](https://github.com/rahulSlash/data-structures-algorithms-javascript)  
- [Stack](https://github.com/rahulSlash/data-structures-algorithms-javascript)
